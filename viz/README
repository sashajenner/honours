Tools for SLOW5 data transformation, analysis and visualisation are found here.

The Raw Format
--------------
Apart from SLOW5 files, some of these tools read and write newline-separated
numerical data with a header, or simply 'numbers in a column'. For example:

	raw_signal
	649
	565
	541
	535
	535

Run the following script to combine all the signal data from a SLOW5 file into
this format:

	./get_sigs.sh SLOW5 > SLOW5.raw

From now on, let's refer to this format as "the raw format".

Transformations
---------------
The following programs take a SLOW5 file as input, perform a transformation, and
output data in the raw format:

get_deltas_slow5.c   | successive differences
get_deltas_slow5_2.c | second-order differences

The following programs take the raw format as input, perform a transformation,
and output the modified data:

get_deltas.c | successive differences
get_zigzag.c | zigzag
get_zd.c     | zigzag differences

Analysis
--------
The following programs take a SLOW5 file as input, analyse it in some way, and
output data in the raw format:

get_exceptions.c | exceptional differences
get_len_sigs.sh  | read count

The following programs take the raw format as input and analyse it in some way:

sigstat.c | count, min, max, mean, var, sd
freq.c    | frequency table
prob.c    | probablity table
parity.c  | frequency table of even and odd numbers
trally.c  | transition frequency table

The following programs take a SLOW5 file as input and generate frequency tables
of the signal values:

freq_slow5.c          | frequency table
create_freq_tables.sh | raw and pA frequency tables

The following programs take the frequency table data as input and analyse it in
some way:

freq_analysis.R | count, min, q1, mean, median, q3, max, mode, var, std, entropy
get_mode.R      | mode
get_quartile.R  | quartiles

Run the following script to create raw and pA signal frequency tables (if not
already created) and save analysis results to disk:

	./analyse_dist.sh SLOW5

Read Analysis
-------------
The following programs take a SLOW5 file as input, perform a transformation to
each read's signals, and then output statistics and meta-data for each read:

print_stats.c         | no transformation
print_stats_diff.c    | successive differences
print_stats_stall.c   | stall

The statistics include the signal count, and the min, max, mean, var and sd of
the raw signals, as well as after converting to pico-amperes (pA). The meta-data
includes the read ID, digitisation, offset, range, rate, channel number, median
before, read number, start mux and start time.

The following program take this statistics data as input and analyses it:

ida.R | read analysis

The following programs takes a SLOW5 file as input and generate a frequency
table of the read lengths:

freq_readlen_slow5.c         | read length frequency table (print)
create_freq_table_readlen.sh | read length frequency table (write to disk)

Run the following script to create the read length frequency table (if not
already created) and save analysis results to disk:

	./analyse_dist_readlen.sh SLOW5

Visualisation
-------------
The following programs take the raw format as input and generate some
visualisations:

sig.R      | line plot
sighist.R  | histogram
sigdense.R | density histogram

The following program takes as input a frequency table and creates a histogram:

freq_plot.R | histogram

Run the following script to create raw and pA frequency tables (if not already
created) and save histogram plots to disk:

	./plot_dist.sh SLOW5

Similarly, for the read length frequency table:

	./plot_dist_readlen.sh SLOW5

The following program takes as input the transition frequency table data from
trally.c and generates some visualisations:

trally.R | transition heatmap

The following program takes the compression benchmark output from the
../press/test.c program as input, and generates some visualisations:

plot_ratio.R | compression benchmark viz

Other
-----
util/rm_hdr.sh | print a SLOW5 file without the header
